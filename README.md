# Three.js Solar System Simulation 
This project is a 3D simulation of the solar system built using Three.js. It includes all major planets, their realistic orbits, scaled sizes and distances, as well as basic lighting and camera controls. Saturn and Uranus have rings, and Earth includes a revolving moon.

## Features

- Scaled planets based on approximate relative sizes
- Orbital paths using TorusGeometry
- Rotational animation and revolution of each planet
- Ambient and point lighting for sun simulation
- Interactive camera using OrbitControls
- Saturn and Uranus rings
- Earthâ€™s moon with revolution
